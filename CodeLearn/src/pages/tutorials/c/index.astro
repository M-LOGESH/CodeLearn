    <p>
      The <strong class="text-custom-primary">C programming language</strong> is one of the most influential and widely used languages in computer science. 
      Created by <strong>Dennis Ritchie</strong> in the early 1970s at Bell Labs, C quickly became the foundation for modern programming — 
      forming the backbone of languages like <strong>C++</strong>, <strong>Java</strong>, <strong>Python</strong>, and <strong>Go</strong>.
    </p>

    <p>
      C is a <strong>structured, procedural, and low-level language</strong> that provides direct access to memory and hardware. 
      It offers unparalleled control over system resources, making it ideal for building 
      <span class="text-custom-primary font-medium">operating systems, device drivers, embedded systems, and compilers</span>.
    </p>

    <p>
      Despite being over 50 years old, C remains one of the most relevant programming languages today. 
      It is fast, portable, and extremely efficient — qualities that have kept it alive in performance-critical software, 
      from <strong>Linux kernels</strong> to <strong>IoT devices</strong> and even <strong>game engines</strong>.

      <h2 class="text-xl sm:text-2xl font-semibold text-custom-accent mb-3">Why Learn C?</h2>
      <p>
        Learning C helps you develop a deep understanding of how computers execute programs, manage memory, and process data. 
        Once you understand C, learning other languages becomes easier because you grasp the core concepts that underpin all programming.
      </p>
      <p class="mt-3">
        Whether you’re a <strong>beginner</strong> or an experienced developer, mastering C gives you 
        the power to write efficient, portable, and robust software.
